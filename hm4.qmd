## Question 1
::: {.callout-tip}
## 30 points
Automatic differentiation using `torch`
:::

###### 1.1 (5 points)

Consider $g(x, y)$ given by
$$
g(x, y) = (x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2.
$$


Using elementary calculus derive the expressions for

$$
\frac{d}{dx}g(x, y), \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{d}{dy}g(x, y).
$$


Using your answer from above, what is the answer to
$$
\frac{d}{dx}g(x, y) \Bigg|_{(x=3, y=4)} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{d}{dy}g(x, y) \Bigg|_{(x=3, y=4)} ?
$$

Define $g(x, y)$ as a function in R, compute the gradient of $g(x, y)$ with respect to $x=3$ and $y=4$. Does the answer match what you expected?
```{R}
g <- function(x, y) {
  (x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2
}

dx_g <- function(x, y) {
  2 * (x - 3)
}
dy_g <- function(x, y) {
  2 * (y - 4)
}

grad_x_3 <- dx_g(3, 4)
grad_y_4 <- dy_g(3, 4)

cat("Gradient with respect to x at (3, 4):", grad_x_3, "\n")
cat("Gradient with respect to y at (3, 4):", grad_y_4, "\n")
```

###### 1.2 (10 points)


$$\newcommand{\u}{\boldsymbol{u}}\newcommand{\v}{\boldsymbol{v}}$$

Consider $h(\u, \v)$ given by
$$
h(\u, \v) = (\u \cdot \v)^3,
$$
where $\u \cdot \v$ denotes the dot product of two vectors, i.e., $\u \cdot \v = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i v_i.$

Using elementary calculus derive the expressions for the gradients

$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_\u h(\u, \v) &= \Bigg(\frac{d}{du_1}h(\u, \v), \frac{d}{du_2}h(\u, \v), \dots, \frac{d}{du_n}h(\u, \v)\Bigg)
\end{aligned}
$$

Using your answer from above, what is the answer to $\nabla_\u h(\u, \v)$ when $n=10$ and

$$
\begin{aligned}
\u = (-1, +1, -1, +1, -1, +1, -1, +1, -1, +1)\\
\v = (-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1)
\end{aligned}
$$

Define $h(\u, \v)$ as a function in R, initialize the two vectors $\u$ and $\v$ as `torch_tensor`s. Compute the gradient of $h(\u, \v)$ with respect to $\u$. Does the answer match what you expected?

```{R}
u <- torch_tensor(c(-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1), dtype = torch_float32, requires_grad = TRUE)
v <- torch_tensor(c(-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), dtype = torch_float32)

h <- function(u, v) {
  dot_product <- sum(u * v)
  (dot_product ^ 3)
}
h_value <- h(u, v)
h_value$backward()
u$grad
```

###### 1.3 (5 points)

Consider the following function
$$
f(z) = z^4 - 6z^2 - 3z + 4
$$

Derive the expression for 
$$
f'(z_0) = \frac{df}{dz}\Bigg|_{z=z_0}
$$
$$
and evaluate $f'(z_0)$ when $z_0 = -3.5$.

Define $f(z)$ as a function in R, and using the `torch` library compute $f'(-3.5)$. 
$$

```{R}
z <- torch_tensor(-3.5, dtype = torch_float32(), requires_grad = TRUE)
f <- function(z) {
  z^4 - 6 * z^2 - 3 * z + 4
}
f_value <- f(z)
f_value$backward()
z$grad

```
---

###### 1.4 (5 points)

For the same function $f$, initialize $z[1] = -3.5$, and perform $n=100$ iterations of **gradient descent**, i.e., 

> $z[{k+1}] = z[k] - \eta f'(z[k]) \ \ \ \ $ for $k = 1, 2, \dots, 100$

Plot the curve $f$ and add taking $\eta = 0.02$, add the points $\{z_0, z_1, z_2, \dots z_{100}\}$ obtained using gradient descent to the plot. What do you observe?
```{R}
f <- function(z) {
  z^4 - 6 * z^2 - 3 * z + 4
}

eta <- 0.02
n_iterations <- 100
z_values <- numeric(n_iterations + 1)
z_values[1] <- -3.5 

for (k in 1:n_iterations) {
  z <- torch_tensor(z_values[k], dtype = torch_float32(), requires_grad = TRUE)
  
  f_value <- f(z)
  f_value$backward()
  
  z_values[k + 1] <- z$item() - eta * z$grad$item()
}

z_seq <- seq(-5, 2, length.out = 1000)
f_seq <- sapply(z_seq, function(x) x^4 - 6 * x^2 - 3 * x + 4)

plot(z_seq, f_seq, type = 'l', main = "Gradient Descent on f(z)", xlab = "z", ylab = "f(z)", col = 'blue')
points(z_values, sapply(z_values, function(x) x^4 - 6 * x^2 - 3 * x + 4), col = 'red', pch = 19)
```

The gradient descent path begins at the far left, starting from $z[1] = -3.5$.
As iterations progress, the points move rightward, indicating an increase in the value of $z_k$.
The points seem to be converging to a point on the curve, suggesting the algorithm is nearing a local minimum of the function $f(z)$.
The spacing between the points decreases as they approach the minimum, which is consistent with the gradient becoming smaller as it approaches a minimum.
---

###### 1.5 (5 points)


Redo the same analysis as **Question 1.4**, but this time using $\eta = 0.03$. What do you observe? What can you conclude from this analysis
```{R}
f <- function(z) {
  z^4 - 6 * z^2 - 3 * z + 4
}

eta <- 0.03
n_iterations <- 100
z_values <- numeric(n_iterations + 1)
z_values[1] <- -3.5 

for (k in 1:n_iterations) {
  z <- torch_tensor(z_values[k], dtype = torch_float32(), requires_grad = TRUE)
  
  f_value <- f(z)
  f_value$backward()
  
  z_values[k + 1] <- z$item() - eta * z$grad$item()
}

z_seq <- seq(-5, 2, length.out = 1000)
f_seq <- sapply(z_seq, function(x) x^4 - 6 * x^2 - 3 * x + 4)

plot(z_seq, f_seq, type = 'l', main = "Gradient Descent on f(z)", xlab = "z", ylab = "f(z)", col = 'blue')
points(z_values, sapply(z_values, function(x) x^4 - 6 * x^2 - 3 * x + 4), col = 'red', pch = 19)
```
The points begin at the same place, $z[1] = -3.5$, and move rightward towards the minimum, similar to the previous plot with $\eta = 0.02$.
However, with the increased learning rate of $\eta = 0.03$, the points appear to be more spaced out compared to those in the previous plot. This suggests larger steps towards the minimum due to the higher learning rate.
Despite the larger steps, the points do not seem to overshoot the minimum and are still converging. This could indicate that $\eta = 0.03$ is still within a reasonable range for this particular function's landscape.
The algorithm appears to be converging to the minimum, as shown by the decreasing gradient (visible by the spacing between points getting smaller).

## Question 2
::: {.callout-tip}
## 50 points
Logistic regression and interpretation of effect sizes
:::

For this question we will use the **Titanic** dataset from the Stanford data archive. This dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic and whether or not they survived. 


---

###### 2.1 (5 points)

Read the data from the following URL as a tibble in R. Preprocess the data such that the variables are of the right data type, e.g., binary variables are encoded as factors, and convert all column names to lower case for consistency. Let's also rename the response variable `Survival` to `y` for convenience.

```{R}
url <- "https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/stuff/titanic.csv"

df <- read_csv(url) %>%
  rename(y = Survived) %>%
  mutate(
    y = as.factor(y),
    Sex = as.factor(Sex),
    Pclass = as.factor(Pclass)
  ) %>%
  rename_with(tolower, everything())
  head(df)

```

---

###### 2.2 (5 points)

Visualize the correlation matrix of all numeric columns in `df` using `corrplot()`

```{R}
df %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  cor() %>%
  corrplot(method = "circle", type = "upper", order = "hclust", 
           tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45, 
           addCoef.col = "black", number.cex = 0.7, 
           title = "Correlation Matrix of Numeric Variables")
```



---

###### 2.3 (10 points)

Fit a logistic regression model to predict the probability of surviving the titanic as a function of:

* `pclass`
* `sex`
* `age`
* `fare`
* `# siblings`
* `# parents`


```{R}
full_model <- glm(y ~ pclass + sex + age + fare + `siblings/spouses aboard` + `parents/children aboard`, 
                  data = df, 
                  family = binomial(link = "logit"))

summary(full_model)
```

---

###### 2.4 (30 points)

Provide an interpretation for the slope and intercept terms estimated in `full_model` in terms of the log-odds of survival in the titanic and in terms of the odds-ratio (if the covariate is also categorical).

Intercept (4.109777)
pclass2 (-1.161491)
pclass3 (-2.350022)
::: {.callout-hint}
## 
Recall the definition of logistic regression from the lecture notes, and also recall how we interpreted the slope in the linear regression model (particularly when the covariate was categorical).

## Question 3
::: {.callout-tip}
## 70 points

Variable selection and logistic regression in `torch`

:::


---

###### 3.1 (15 points)

Complete the following function `overview` which takes in two categorical vectors (`predicted` and `expected`) and outputs:

* The prediction accuracy
* The prediction error
* The false positive rate, and
* The false negative rate

```{R}
overview <- function(predicted, expected){
    predicted <- as.factor(predicted)
    expected <- as.factor(expected)
  

    total_false_positives <- sum(predicted == "1" & expected == "0")
    total_true_positives <-  sum(predicted == "1" & expected == "1")
    total_false_negatives <- sum(predicted == "0" & expected == "1")
    total_true_negatives <- sum(predicted == "0" & expected == "0")
    false_positive_rate <- total_false_positives / (total_false_positives + total_true_negatives)
    false_negative_rate <-  total_false_negatives / (total_false_negatives + total_true_positives)
    accuracy <- (total_true_positives + total_true_negatives) / length(expected)
    error <- 1 - accuracy
    return(
        data.frame(
            accuracy = accuracy, 
            error=error, 
            false_positive_rate = false_positive_rate, 
            false_negative_rate = false_negative_rate
        )
    )
}
```

You can check if your function is doing what it's supposed to do by evaluating

```{R}
overview(df$y, df$y)
```
and making sure that the accuracy is $100\%$ while the errors are $0\%$.
---

###### 3.2 (5 points)

Display an overview of the key performance metrics of `full_model`

```{R}
probabilities <- predict(full_model, df, type = "response")
predicted <- ifelse(probabilities > 0.5, "1", "0")
expected <- df$y
expected <- factor(expected, levels = levels(predicted))
performance_metrics <- overview(predicted, expected)
print(performance_metrics)

```

---

###### 3.3  (5 points)

Using backward-stepwise logistic regression, find a parsimonious altenative to `full_model`, and print its `overview`

```{R}
step_model <- step(full_model, direction = "backward")
summary(step_model)
```

```{R}
step_predictions <- ifelse(predict(step_model, df, type = "response") > 0.5, "1", "0")
overview(step_predictions, df$y)
```

---

###### 3.4  (15 points)

Using the `caret` package, setup a **$5$-fold cross-validation** training method using the `caret::trainConrol()` function

```{R}
controls <- trainControl() # ... insert your code here
```

Now, using `control`, perform $5$-fold cross validation using `caret::train()` to select the optimal $\lambda$ parameter for LASSO with logistic regression. 

Take the search grid for $\lambda$ to be in $\{ 2^{-20}, 2^{-19.5}, 2^{-19}, \dots, 2^{-0.5}, 2^{0} \}$.

```{R}
x <- df[, !(names(df) %in% "y")]
y <- df$y
y <- factor(y, levels = unique(y))


lasso_fit <- train(
  x = x,
  y = y,
  method = "glmnet",
  trControl = controls, 
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(
    alpha = 1,
    lambda = 2^seq(-20, 0, by = 0.5)
    ),
  family = "binomial",
  metric = "ROC",
  preProcess = c("center", "scale")
)
```
Using the information stored in `lasso_fit$results`, plot the results for  cross-validation accuracy vs. $log_2(\lambda)$. Choose the optimal $\lambda^*$, and report your results for this value of $\lambda^*$.

---

###### 3.5  (25 points)

First, use the `model.matrix()` function to convert the covariates of `df` to a matrix format

```{R}
covariate_matrix <- model.matrix(full_model)[, -1]
```

Now, initialize the covariates $X$ and the response $y$ as `torch` tensors

```{R}
X <- torch_tensor(as.matrix(covariate_matrix), dtype = torch_float32())
y <- torch_tensor(as.numeric(df$y) - 1, dtype = torch_float32())
```

Using the `torch` library, initialize an `nn_module` which performs logistic regression for this dataset. (Remember that we have 6 different covariates)

```{R}
logistic <- nn_module(
  initialize = function() {
    self$f <- nn_linear(in_features = ncol(covariate_matrix), out_features = 1)

  },
  forward = function(x) {
    x %>% self$f() %>% torch_sigmoid()
  }
)

f <- logistic()
```

You can verify that your code is right by checking that the output to the following code is a vector of probabilities:

```{R}
f(X)
```


Now, define the loss function `Loss()` which takes in two tensors `X` and `y` and a function `Fun`, and outputs the **Binary cross Entropy loss** between `Fun(X)` and `y`. 

```{R}
Loss <- function(X, y, Fun){
  predicted_probabilities <- Fun(X)
  y_reshaped <- y$view(-1, 1)
  loss <- nnf_binary_cross_entropy(input = predicted_probabilities, target = y_reshaped)
  return(loss)
}
```

Initialize an optimizer using `optim_adam()` and perform $n=1000$ steps of gradient descent in order to fit logistic regression using `torch`.

```{R}

f <- logistic()
optimizer <- optim_adam(f$parameters, lr = 0.01) 

n <- 1000
for (i in 1:n) {
  optimizer$zero_grad()
  loss <- Loss(X, y, function(x) f$forward(x))
  loss$backward()
  optimizer$step()
  
  if (i %% 100 == 0) {
    cat("Iteration:", i, "Loss:", loss$item(), "\n")
  }
}
```

Using the final, optimized parameters of `f`, compute the compute the predicted results on `X`

```{R}
predicted_probabilities <- f(X) %>% as_array()
torch_predictions <- f(X) %>% as_array() %>% .[, 1]

overview(torch_predictions, df$y)
```

---

###### 3.6  (5 points)

Create a summary table of the `overview()` summary statistics for each of the $4$ models we have looked at in this assignment, and comment on their relative strengths and drawbacks.
